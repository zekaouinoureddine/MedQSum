I know that it is a blood disorder and can cause Lupus and a lot of other problems, but she is having a real hard time dealing with this. When it first started, I took her to the Dr. because she was having trouble breathing. They thought she had pneumonia and prescribed her medication for that.

I myself have received several treatments with ECT because I also have bipolar disorder. Now I want to know if there is any risk to suffer from narcolepsy as a result of ECT. Is there any research in this area? I m from Sweden and writes not so good at English so I apologize for all the errors, but I hope you understand what I wonder about.

I ve been very interested in monitoring my blood pressure so I bought a home kit that I use. My average blood pressure is at about 130\/85 when sitting. I am aware that my blood pressure drops when standing. When I test myself standing, the readings puzzle me because I do not know how to interpret the results. There is also very little information online about this - readings such as 113\/87 HR 85, 115\/85 HR 84. I find the lack of disparity between the Systolic and Diastolic reading puzzling I am also aware that my HR should go when I stand up to compensate for the pooling of blood in my legs, however, it seems to slow to 65 BP from 90 BP or so, before jumping to about 98 BP after standing. When this happens, I get a sensation in my stomach similar to gagging (I don t gag, just the stomach pressure) and pressure building behind my ears from my neck. I replicated the slowing of the HR by utilizing my gag complex successfully. I m curious if this is related to the odd blood pressure reading or if any of this is part of the Orthostatic Hypotension I was diagnosed with...","54":"hi! i am 23 yrs old and i am trying to get pregnant from past 2 yrs. my husband is 30 yrs old. i have pcod. doctor suggested iui. but iui was done 24 hrs after hcg ingection was given. scanning report showed that it was not ruptured. was iui done too earlly.? is there any chance of me getting pregnant by this first attempt of iui. ?","55":"I experienced hypothermia about three years ago it was a very mild case but about a year ago i noticed i was having weird shivers i mever thought much about them but come across online that they were tremors and wondered if the hypothermia could have caused them?","56":"I was diagnoses with Primary Raynauds at 12.

I started with 20mg of Concerta, then switched to 50mg of Vyvanse, then 60mg of Vyvanse, then I started to feel depressed and I wasn t having the same focused effect as when I first started with Concerta 20mg. So, now I m taking 52mg of Concerta and it kind of works but not as effective as 20mg of Concerta when I was first put on medication six years ago. Also, today I have a lot of work to do, and I took one pill of 52mg of Concerta at 9am, and took another at 1pm because I thought it would give me an extra focus boost, and all it has been doing is make me feel like I have a pain in my heart because it feels like its moving really fast.

She had been admitted into the hospital with bronchitis, was hospitalized for aprox. 5 days. Was readmitted within 3 days after leaving the hospital. This time she had pneumonia. At first they said it was a staph pneumonia. She stayed in this time almost a week, was released, went home and passed away in her sleep within 4-5 days after coming home. She called me the night before she passed away and told me she may have to go back in the hospital as she was not feeling well. I begged her to go in right away and she assured me she was going to. Well, she didn t and we got a call the next day that she passed away in her sleep that night in her bed. I am heartbroken. Did she pick a bug up in the hospital that could have taken her life?","147":"I am a 64 year old female in what I thought in pretty good health.

I developed it to manage my low back pain after severe L5-S1 herniation, use it every day and am sure of its effectiveness. My offer might be of some good profit if ElFAD is sold in the USA (or any other country) but officially it needs clinical pilot study first (see programms emails ). Please note I am not a company, just a retired Russian medical doctor living in Hove. I ve written this to you in hope a company could be created in your country to introduce my ElFAD device-method into medical practice that might make profit to you and the country. I offer you to make business on my ElFAD method. Or investigate, \u043er sponsor it. My device to treat low back pain (LBP) is patented in the UK, method pending in the USA where I have right to sell, simple, safe and effective auto-decompression method to be used at home. I cannot fill in any application form as do not understand that official language. Could you introduce it into medical practice? As a medical doctor using this method to treat my low back pain I can claim that: 1.This method kept me, a young LBP patient, capable to work. 2. It was cost-effective as all the other treatments were abandoned. 3. It keeps me, now an old LBP patient, from becoming a back cripple (unfortunately, there is no absolute cure for heavily herniated disc LBP). 4. The most important advantage of this method is that it is a self-help, self-manage method to decompress vertebrae strictly along the spine axis. I do not go to my GP or hospital, I use it at home any time suitable and my GP here does not even know that I have a back problem. There are some other advantages of this method that require further investigation: 1. Using this method by patients with simple backache might prevent subsequent disc injury that is highly possible in this group. 2. This method may be a helpful and cost-effective treatment for patients with neck pain. 3. This method may be a helpful and cost-effective treatment for patients with ankylosing spondylitis. 4. It may be reasonable to use this method for preventative measures by people in groups of risk: sedentary mode of life, drivers, porters, weight-lifters, oarsmen and some other sportsmen or parachute jumpers. 5. This method can be used for spine curvature correction. 6. Regular use of this method might prevent development of osteoporosis in the bones of spine, upper limbs and shoulder girdle (it is a positive side effect). 7. This method might prevent periodontal disorders providing the gums massage (it is another positive side effect of this method). This is absolutely new and effective method - it will decrease the number of hospital visits, it will reduce the cost of care. And it can help soldiers. My device is extremely simple. It will be very cheap to manufacture but the profit might be high and fast (for example see that huge back pain market in the USA where my device is pending and already electronically published). To examine the method you only need really suffering LBP patients and my device that I myself can bring.

I didnt think much of it, but later on got numbess feeling in the leg and knee. Now 2 years later, i cant maturbate witthout that position, cause it kinda open up for the sensation. I can keep at it all day if my legs are in line, but the second i cross em ( and maybe relief something in the hip area) i get the sensation back in. Its like something is blocked in there.

About fifteen months ago, I travelled to Sierra Leone in northwest Africa where I spent about seventeen days.  I faithfully took my malaria pills and was extremely careful about my drinking water and what I ate.  Several months after my return, I began having problems with dairy products (yogurt, milk, ice cream, etc) when I consumed more than maybe a third or half a cup within a twenty four hour period.  I suffer from stomach pains and some times diarrhea (neither of which is ever debilitating) after the consumption of such an amount of diary products.

But it's slightly obvious when I palpate it or when I turn my foot to the side. I acquired this last year while I was on vacation. I rode a boat and hopped down a bit fast from a high surface and ended up landing hard on the side of my foot on the wooden surface of the boat. It hurt, but because we were on vacation and it wasn't bleeding nor swelling, I thought nothing of it.After the vacation, i noticed the slight deformity or bump days later. It only hurts when I walk for a long time in slippers. I know it has something to do with the bump because I never used to get foot pains on the side of my foot until the incident.What should I do? Is this bump permanent? Is my foot bone deformed? Do I need surgery for this? Can massaging the side of my foot help or worsen the situation?:O? Thank you sincerely!","283":"my daughter had a bowel obstruction and a n obstruction of the left ureter and a non functioning left kidney.
