My (paternal) grandmother had a cerebral (word choice?) aneurysm in her mid-forties and there is a history of heart disease on that side (my father, my father's father, etc).  A (second?; maternal) cousin had an aortic aneurysm (not sure where).  I have no pain, just a transient pulsating feeling in my upper abdomen (epigastric-to-umbilical region - moreso epigastric, though) from time to time (e.g., primarily during times of mild stress or after eating).   I have recently had one or two episodes of numbness in my right leg lately but I'm not sure if that has more to do with the fact that I do a lot of sitting (at work, commute to and from work, etc).  I've noticed an increase in 'heart flutters' - for example, sometimes when I wake up in the morning but before I get out of bed.  Not sure if that's related.  Could be related to caffeine.  I've gotten them as far back as I can remember.When swimming, there are times where I feel like I have heart flutters as well.  It makes me uncomfortable enough to take a break. Typically while doing breast stroke (as apposed to freestyle for some reason).  I'm not even sure why I'm so concerned.  I guess maybe it is because I had a recent episode of nausea brought on by the feeling that I might pass out.  I am NOT pregnant. In fact, I thought it might somehow be related to constipation.  Turns out I was not constipated either.  It was a peculiar feeling and not the first time I've experienced it.  Seemingly, it came out of 'nowhere' - as opposed to something I might have eaten.  I don't know.  I figured I'd give this a shot. Thanks for you time.","22":"I have had frontal fibrosing alopecia for 4yrs now, but was aware of the condition only this past year.

Several weeks back, I thought I heard my friend say my name at swim practice. He didn t. Since then, my mental health has seemingly gone downhill fast, and it has worried me so incredibly much. Every time I hear a noise that I don t know the source of, I have gotten really scared. But, I figured I was just being paranoid about it. But, recently, particularly in the last few days, I ve had random thoughts just pop into my head. I don t know how to explain it, but they re soft, and they re not mine, at all. For instance, I was reading a article a few hours ago, and the word communists just popped into my head. Just the word, nothing else, and it seems as if I didnt think of it. It s like having auditory hallucinations, but you don t hear them, you think them. In the last few weeks, I occasionally would have one of those random thoughts once or twice a day. But today, I ve had countless. At the same time, I ve had ringing ears. I ll turn my head, and the ringing will stop. It scares me, and I think I m going crazy. Today, I also heard beeping in my ears, and what sounded like construction. And, whenever I think or reflect on the ringing in my ears, it comes back again. So, am I developing schizophrenia, have I gone completely insane?","82":"My daughter is 23 and she met and started dating her first boyfriend on Sept 9th.

She has had Myasthenia Gravis for over 55 years and has been in a wheelchair most of that time. A few years ago she was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. This past year she began feeling pain in her neck and shoulder and was told it was spinal stenosis. She has successfully used Prostigmine for years to help with her muscle weakness, however it become unavailable this past summer so she switched to Mestinon for 6 months. She did not do very well on the Mestinon. Her muscles were weak and she was not as mentally sharp as she normally is \u2013 I kept thinking her sodium was low. During the 6 months she was on the Mestinon she fell out of her wheel chair and hit her head on the bathroom sink giving her mild subdural hematoma. An MRI was done and everything looked ok. After all this her neck dropped forward. Over about a 3 month period her head dropped and is causing her pain and discomfort and making eating and swallowing difficult due to the forward position of her neck. Her facial muscles are not weak. Her neurologist performed an EMG and there was evidence of mild exacerbation of MG symptoms. Meanwhile we found some Prostigmine and switched her from Mestinon back to Prostigmin. Her mind clarity improved immediately and her muscle strength improved enough so that she is again able to transfer herself from chair to wheelchair, but her head is still dropped. She tried IVIG treatment but that did not help. She\u2019s considering plasma apheresis which helped her about 30 years ago during a difficult MG period.

I am currently 21 y\/o. My gyn prescribed me to take Premphase, so that I could still have a cycle every month. I have had full cycles all the way until May, then in June no cycle, light spotting in July (spread out over a few days sporadic throughout the month), and no cycle in August. I called my gyn (and talked to a nurse) after the no June cycle, and they said that it was normal to have just spotting or not a period at all while taking Premphase, so I didn't worry too much.  For the last two and a half weeks I was feeling nauseated in the mornings and this past Friday, I even vomited. I have also experienced headaches, tender breasts, and heightened sense of smell.  I took about 4 HPT's over two days and got all positives. I was told by my gyn that I my likelihood of conceiving naturally was slim to none. I went to our state county health department, and they confirmed the pregnancy with a urine test. They said I would be due in February 2012. The nurse had not heard of my medicine and about it affecting my periods. I do not think this is a correct due date, but I am not sure. What I am most concerned with is am I really pregnant? Did my ovaries just kick back in (as my gyn said COULD happen) or the HRT help me concieve? Could this be a false positive because of my medicine or something else? They did not do a blood test, which worried me. I can't see my gyn for another 2 weeks or so because I am waiting on state insurance to kick in, I just need some advice and peace of mind.

He just woke up one day last August with this terrible disease. We live in a small town in Central Oregon. He just started seeing his primary doctor and today had an appointment. He looked really bummed when I picked him up. When I asked what was wrong with him- He replied: The doctor is going to paralyze my left side from the neck down. I am no doctor, but, he hasn t gotten a second opinion. I asked him what was the benefit of paralysis comparing to his condition now. I asked him which would he rather live with- not using his whole left side or having his neck like it is. He replied: my neck like it is. I am so glad he became my resident because I don t feel like not enough information about tortacollis (spelling wrong) has been given to him. He told me one doctor said it was caused by amitriptilyne (spelling) Are there no early signs to this disease? And do you think he should have the procedure done without a 2nd opinion. I want to as his primary doctor: How many cases have you treated like this? Please answer as much as you can. My resident has had seizures and can t swallow very well as time goes on. Thank you for your time. Faydra Johnsoon","369":"Good afternoon. My little brother was just diagnosed with torticollis at 14.

I now have kidney damage from it. I am finally working with about 75% of my kidneys again after about 2 years of suffering and near death. I was never put on dialysis for it.

I am also in a wheelchair due to my right knee needing to be replaced and having lymphedema in both legs. My thighs are the size of tree trunks. I have lost almost 200 pounds on my own in the last year and a half and I have found a gym that has equipment, classes and water aerobics for people in a chair. I am still however hovering at about 400 pounds. I do not ever want to go back to where I was, but I still need to lose over 200 pounds. Finally, my question is, do you think it would be ok to have the gastric sleeve surgery done? If so, after I am healed from that and well on my way to being done with the weight loss, do you know of any surgeons that would remove these huge sacks of hanging skin from the insides of my thighs left from the lymphedema? I was told that the area was very vascular and hardly any surgeon would touch me to do that. After all of that I would finally get the knee replacement and skin removal surgery.

Over the past 6-7 years she had been falling in the house and I noticed after the falling she had been experiencing some forgetfulness. She has been to a neurologist about 5 years ago and he had given her a mini-mental state test, and sent her for neuropsych testing. She also suffers from renal insufficiency due to hypertension (she is in Stage 3). She was in stage 4 but a nephrologist has her in stage 3 due to the right medications. Her mother had died from uremic poisoning over 50 years ago (no dialysis then). Anyway, the neurologist based on his examinations and testing feels that she is in a mild to moderate stage of alzheimer. Her cardiologist told me that she has microvascular leukoencepahlopaty (she also has hardenining of the arteries). Her primary care physician feels that her dementia is microvascular (AKA vascular due to small vessel disease; she also has diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, cholesterol.) She was a smoker, but stopped about 17 years ago. She also has perepheral artery disease. She is on many medications including aricept and namenda. She also experiences parkinson-like tremors. She had a eeg showing a slows of speech language done about 4 years ago. Based on what I have told you is this dementia of a vascular origin, or is it a mixed dementia? She is currently 86 years old and resides in a nursing home. I know I witnessed while she was at home some forgetfulness like leaving a stove on, poor hygiene, moods swings (verbally and hitting). Also, she would have auditory & visual hallucinations (hearing music, talking to imaginary people). I thought at this point she would be better in a facility where she is exposed to people her age and mind stimulation would be more available than staying at home with a home health aide. She had a sister who had passed away last year at 83 years old from alzheimer. Could both sisters have the same thing?

In late January as part of an effort to find the cause of my implacable lethargy and nudged in this direction by recurrent episodes of greying out that were becoming more frequent, I underwent a tilt table test. The results were that my heart rate increased from ~ 80 bpm to 130 bpm upon being tilted (the increase began sharply as soon as I was tilted) and this heart rate gradually settled down to about 100 bpm after twenty minutes. I was given sublingual nitrate which caused my heart rate to increase again to ~ 130 bpm. The heart rate increase was accompanied by palpitations which lasted until the test was completed but on the day of the test doctors were unable to replicate my symptoms of presyncope. No syncope occurred during the test. For days after the test I was very significantly impaired. Other symptoms I experienced that appeared to be related to a common condition included: severe post-prandial fatigue (to the point it was difficult to organise my thoughts and even to talk for about 2-3 hours after eating a meal\u2014a sandwich with wholemeal bread would be enough to trigger this), cognitive sluggishness (not too remote from the complex of symptoms an ADHD person would experience), post-exertional fatigue (I would not be able to function adequately after exercising and was effectively bed or chair-ridden until I had a very long episode of sleep\u2014for obvious reasons I would never, ever exercise in the morning), fatigue in response to being in any sort of hot environment (especially hot showers), muscular discomfort (mostly after exercising, it was very similar to what one feels preliminary to stretching) that would be relieved temporarily by stretching and gave me urges to compress affected limbs (I would place one leg in tight spaces, for instance in between lounge cushions on which one generally sits and the backrest of a lounge), urges to lean on things while standing (such as bathroom mirros while brushing my teeth) and excessive thirst (a relative counted twenty-eight 600mL bottles of water on the floor near my bed once). It was inductively strong that the episodes of greying out and other symptoms, according to specialists I am in consultation with, were related to the observed phenomenon during the tilt test which confirmed a diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia. I was given Inderal 40mg, half of which I was instructed to take twice daily, so 20mg in the morning upon waking up and 20mg at night. My response to the medication was uncanny in the positive stense. For several days, after years of this illness, I was asymptomatic. I was expecting to make a full recovery but my symptoms began returning after about a week. Some symptoms appeared to be remain controlled by the Inderal, including the post-prandial fatigue and accompanying drowsiness, but others, such as the muscular pain, the cognitive sluggishness, the greying out and the muscular pain, began returning. I expressed the failure of the medication to control my symptoms beyond a week to my doctor, and he wanted to increase my dosage as he apparently always intended because I am a big guy and a 20mg dose of Inderal twice a day (40mg\/day) is what he would give a six year old (actually, I m not a big guy at all, I am 70kg and 6 0\u201d). My dose was increased to a full tablet at night and half a tablet in the morning and then once again to one full tablet in the morning and one at night over the period of two weeks (it worked out to be more than that). All of the symptoms that were returning before the dose was increased the first time worsened, and suspicions that the Inderal was influencing my mood seem to be confirmed by my moodiness getting worse as well, so now I began experiencing a side effect. I quickly tapered my dose from 80mg\/day to 60mg\/day and then back to 40mg\/day. In the last 24 hours I have taken 20mg two times, so it has been a very short time since the tapering of the medication finished. It is important to stress there has continues to be a full resolution of my post-prandial fatigue, which was the most distressing of my symptoms, but I am at a total loss for why my improvement for the first few days of taking the medication was so holistic and significant, whereas now I am once again impaired, even now when I m on a similar dose to that I first took. I have tried many medications in the past, including ones prescribed for depression because doctors suspected I was atypically depressed, and they have not yielded the same results as Inderal. There have been no significant changes in lifestyle or diet since starting the treatment, with one exception, so what may account for the initial efficacy of the medication versus its efficacy now? I do know that propranolol reduces the sodium present in urine and sodium affects blood pressure and blood volume, and the major change in my diet over a long period has been a decrease in the amount of salt I consume, which I imagine is still relatively high. However, over the last 24 hours I have been consuming more salt, a deviation from the trend, to no avail, at least yet. My blood pressure is not too low, not too high . I am looking for alternative explanations. Should I push for my doctor to prescribe a second line of treatment, in the form of a medication like midodrine or fludrocortisone? Would you personally approve of a second-line pharmacological intervention if I was one of your patients? Should I be concerned about interactions between my current medication, propranolol, and any of these two other medications that make one of them less effective or that imperil my health, save that fludrocortisone requires auxiliary potassium supplementation? To summarise my questions: What may account for the initial efficacy of the Inderal versus its efficacy now? Given the dose has remained the same? Should I broach with my doctor my thoughts about using more medications, to target the postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom complex in different ways? Do you personally think more intervention is warranted given that the medication I am taking now is not having the effect it did? Would Florinef or midodrine interact with propranolol in such a way that is dangerous or one of these medications is rendered less effective because of the other? (From my understanding, potassium depleting drugs are only dangerous with beta-blockers that prolong the QT interval of the heart, which I don t think propranolol does, but I don t want to show up to an appointment with my doctor appearing uninformed, so if I am wrong, I would like to know.)

I feel that this is unlikely however as I have no lump\/protrusion, had all surgeries laparoscopically, have been extremely careful not to strain my abdomen and I am in excellent shape with very strong abdominal muscles.

In the last 6-8 weeks, I have noticed my usually thick and plentiful hair is thinning, especially in the front and top of my head.  Also, in the last couple of weeks, I have felt a small dip\/depression at the top of my skull at the spot where I have a patch of hair loss.  One doctor calls it alapecia caused by stress but wasn't concerned about the depression in the skull.  The Dermatologist didn't seem to have an answer for the hair loss but prescribed a cortisone type lotion for the chronic itching of my scalp, which seems to help.  However, I think the depression in the skull is getting larger and I am wondering if you have any idea what is causing that.  I have had three once-a-year infusions of Aclasta (the Canadian term for Reclast) for my advanced osteoporosis and am thinking that might be the culprit for the hair thinning and patches of hair loss.

About 76 hours ago, before my girlfriend took him home for the night I remember him telling me he was itchy.  about 15 hours after that, 67 hours ago she saw him at a local store picking up medication.  When she asked what it was he apparently said, \"oh, my doctor said I've got chiggers or something\" and she looked at the medicine he was prescribed and called me at work to look it up.  The medication was Permethrin Cream, 5%.  I looked it up and found out it was for scabies treatment.  Within the next day, he was apparently very badly broken out; within the next day and a half following that his girlfriend, my girlfriend's daughter with whom he's had considerable contact with, was broken out and my girlfriend  had complained the night before had an itchy bump on her hip.  That evening my girlfriend and her daughter went to the doctor and were tentatively diagnosed with also being infested with scabies. A skin scrape was done on each but the labs haven't come back yet as it was a Thursday and they were told it would be at least 3-4 days before the lab results came back.  Both have lived in the same apartment since the news and have been in contact with many things in the apartment.  Since it was immediately after\/during the move-in many thing were still yet unpacked.  A lot of the large furniture had been moved around (many times to see how it looked) by the boyfriend and two other people at the same time, as well as me and my girlfriend separately on the last occasion (the one he told me he itched badly as he left).  For three nights I slept with my girlfriend there.  The night before they went to the doctor we had about 20 minutes contact where she manually stimulated me with lubrication and held each other off and on throughout the night.  I was home very little after the initial move to help move things around and touched very few things after I got home late at night after waking up, but I did move the furniture (suede-like cover) and only wore clothes that the original infested person did not touch.  There were, however, things (clothes and otherwise) in our bedroom he did carry that were on the carpet.  I showered in a hot shower, as I always do, every morning before and after this became evident.  As soon as I found out I have never returned to the apartment, have not had any physical contact with my girlfriend or anyone else for that matter.  I am still showing no signs and used about a quarter tube of Permethrin cream on myself the day we all found out.  I'm staying at my parents' house at the time, as the doctor my girlfriend saw advised, for a week or longer.  I still can't really tell any signs but am getting ready to give myself a second treatment of the Permethrin cream as I was not aware I should wear full covering clothing and not wash it off for 24 hours.  I applied the cream fairly thinly except my hands, arms, feet, ankles and genitals (as we had had prolonged contact at that point the night before).  My girlfriend has sprayed things in the apartment down with anti-lice spray after vacuuming but has just nearly three days later gotten to wash all the clothes that were on the floor in bunches of hangers because they were not yet put away.  Mine have been washed in hot water and dried on high heat, as hers have (considering neither of all have been done yet); mine have been delivered to me without her ever touching them (had her wear long rubber gloves) and I have also washed and dried them at my parents' house without me ever touching them.  I have never had scabies before and read that symptoms may take 4-6 weeks to manifest.  My girlfriend and her daughter have both had them within the last year for the first time and have manifest symptoms soon after exposure.  What are my chances of being infested, infesting my immediate family (with which I've had fairly minimal contact now) and what is my best course of action?  --  Thank You for Your Advice -- Travis","694":"Many years ago I was d iagnosed with Tarlov cysts, which are thought to be congenital .M ine are VERY large and may be symptoms of lower back pains.... or not.

This is the highly respected teaching hospital for the University of Florida. The neurologist diagnosed my problem as CAA.

Each of the 8 times I fell I required assistance in getting to an upright position, something that was unknown to me before my stroke of 15 months ago.

The complex is showing obvious widening and the P wave is either missing or is buried in the QRS - difficult to see for sure. One of the consulting ER docs stated that he thought the rhythm looked suspicious of Wolff Parkinson s White and felt he needed an Echo, Stress test and possible interventions as soon as possible. Therefore, he was transferred to a larger hospital with better capabilities and in fact was life-flighted to that facility. He has a hx of PTSD with pseudo-seizures and received treatment at this larger facility in the past. Because of his past history, the current providers are fixated on the part of his record that talks about this and are telling him that they think he is possibly making stuff up . He has been having episodes of passing out. He has a robust family hx of cardiac issues. Mother received a pacemaker this year for WPW and maternal grandmother died in her 40 s from a cardiac type episode (he doesn t know the specifics). Is it possible for someone to fake this type of rhythm ?

I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart\/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) is 4cm wide whereas it should be at maximum 3.8cm (from memory, and I can t remember what was what exactly). Also, there was another measure from the ECG of 450ms or such between beat... Where it should stay under 450 or 430... Again, I do not recall the exact lingo... My question is simple. Are there any known adverse effect to taking a medication such as Rytmonorm, does it affect the initial problem (atrial fibrillation)? Is there any way to remedy the problem without resorting to ablation (which has a low success rate) or cut through the electrical system (old style)... I really would like to get off the medication.

After about 10 days he saw his Dr. stating he must have pulled a muscle (something experienced more than once through his life). Muscle relaxers and prescription Advil didn t help. Prior to seeing the Dr. and for a few days after, he had painted our entire condo inside and plowed driveway snow. He then had an X Ray, followed by a lower spine MRI which showed lesions. Then came a nuclear bone scan which showed Metastatic lesions needing more identification. A Pet Scan was scheduled but by then he was on the sofa all day unable to sit or stand. The scan never took place. He went by ambulance on 2\/23\/14 to the hospital, in pain but with his usual sense of humor. He spent 12 days in the hospital.

I suffer from ET (Essential Thrombocytosis).  I was made aware of the possibility of this condition in 1995 during a routine office visit by my cardiologist.  The cardiologist couldn't get a definitive blood count after a routine CBC was taken and referred me to a hematologist.  Several tests, including bone marrow aspiration, were taken to determine what was going on with my blood.  Turned out to have a blood disorder called ET rendering my platelet count in the low one-millions.  I was immediately put on Anagrelide which I stayed on for approx. 4 years.  But because of severe side affects, specifically palpitations which this hematologist didn't seem to consider serious, given my condition, I sought the services of yet another specialist.  I was introduced to hydroxyurea in high doses which brought about a whole different set of problems.  Where the palpitations were alayed, I began noticing a darkening of my nails, feet and hands, and severe bouts with dizziness, as well as lower back pain, infrequent fatigue, and a host of other side affects caused by this medication.  I was scheduled for another bone marrow aspiration and it was determined that my bone marrow was hardening.  I discussed this with the doctor and advised him that I would no longer take such a high dosage of drugs, thereby having my dosage reduced.  I was not very pleased with this doctor and consequently did some extensive research and ended up with the specialist I now have.  Unlike with the previous specialists, this specialist informed me of other alternatives, none of which of course were holistic, which were explained to me and gave me an opportunity to choose which method of treatment I would rather have.  I opted to stay w\/the Hydrea.  I have now been on the Hydrea for 11 yrs.  As with all previous specialists, and with medication, as I am monitored every 3-4 months, my platelets have continued to be in the mid-500s to 700s.  I currently take 2 500mg hydrea twice a day.  I have read the comments from others who have this condition and we all have similar concerns. . .lukemia, stroke (if med stopped), etc.  What can I do, who can I turn to?  I want to get off this drug, but am fearful of the outcome.","965":"Hi, I am 70, male. Having Diabetes type II last 25 years.

As a child I had my fair share of head injuries. One requiring blood removal from my skull at age 10. I have experienced blank out spells as a child that got me into a lot of trouble at school and at home. My primary doctor back then did not do any tests or send me to see a specialist. Instead I was put on ADHD drugs. I have noticed multiple times what some call auras. I can be watching TV when suddenly everything in the room looks far away and suddenly all sound goes silent. 5 years ago my GI doctor was trying to figure out why my colitis was not responding to medications other than steroids. An endoscopy found a tumor and multiple tests and CT scans later a trauma surgeon took my case and did the surgery. After the surgery my colitis started getting better but my arthritis exploded. I was diagnosed with spondylosis in my neck with multiple collapsed disks. C1 threw C3 are the worst. I began having stronger myoclonic type attacks in the evening before bed and in the morning. My mother would even tell me I was jerking and blanking out during the day for which I had no memory. Also a few back I started having double beart pause heart beats. Sometimes instead of returning to normal beats i would go into tack for a short period. Then suddenly I started getting these slow motion attacks as I tried to sleep a few weeks ago. They would start with an uplifting feeling in my gut that would spread into my chest. All sound would go away as I felt a slow motion electrical type shock hit me that seemed to take minutes rather than seconds. Then suddenly it was over and my heart would be pounding and I would be sweating. The only emotional feeling was scared that it happened wonder what just happened. These attacks happened back to back as the night went along. I ended up not sleeping for 3 nights straight. I contacted my primary and he put me on klonopin 1mg at bedtime and asked me to see a neurologist. The neurologist asked me to see a psychiatrist to rule out panic attacks. Panic attacks were ruled out so i went back to the neurologist. Instead of asking me questions I was chewed out for letting my doctor put me on klonopin or even suggesting I might need an EEG study. I was sent to a sleep study clinic which ruled out sleep apnea and sent me back for an EEG study. My neurologist then gave in and did a 2 hr sleep deprived study which showed nothing despite being told by the tech I had 2 myoclonic type jerks and asked me why I never hit the panic button so they could be identified better. So my neurologist basically pushed me out the door at that point and doesn t want to see me for another year. what bugs me most is that i worked in orthopedics years ago and know that RA in the neck can effect the brain. I also have a family history of ALS and picks disease. What should I do now. Should I seek out a second opinion? If so should this opinion be from another neurologist or a different field like a spine doctor?","975":"Hi, I have been diagnosed with a desmoid tumour in my arm had another lump removed from my tummy although awaiting results.

I also had an MI (95% blockage of the LAD) and stent 6 years ago.  After a year and a half of investigation trying to determine the cause of hypotension (60\/40) and a consistent heart rate in the 120 range, my cardiologist ordered a CT scan that indicates mild cerebral \/ cerebrellar atrophy.  A nerve conduction test last month determined there is sensorimotor poly neuropathy.  I have been plagued with dizziness over the past 14 years.  I've lost 50 pounds since my MI and have kept it off.  About a year ago, my appetite nose-dived and I dropped to 142 pounds (5' 8\" tall).  Is the atrophy something I need to be concerned about is the basic question.  I have been referred to a neurologist whom I will see in late February.  I should also mention that I started to develop a slight tremor in my hands about 3 years ago, have memory issues, trouble reading and understanding.  The numbness in my feet is quickly moving up my legs.  Thanks so much for your time and kind help. Rick","1051":"What is the most current treatment for lymphedema of the leg?

All her tests came normal except for the WBC count(it is 17000 currently) and the ct scan shows significant right lung damage.She is not having any other symptoms except for the recurring chills and fever. Despite all the tests done the doctors are not able to figure out as to what exactly is wrong so they are not in a position to prescribe any specific medicines. My mother is still in the hospital(in Bangalore). Please help. She used to take meds for high bp for 10years and also has an elevated level of creatinine .","1258":"What are the reasons of Appendicitis ?
