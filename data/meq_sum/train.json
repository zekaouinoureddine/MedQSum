I hadn't been operated at that point only later, in 2003 when the pressure was very high (above 30 mp). This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser, removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil, replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp. However, the eye got blood, retina got detached and it had to be operated again. This time, the oil replaced with gas.\nAfter 2 years, another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas, but the retina fallen again and again.\nCurrently, the retina is still detached, the pressure is low (max 4 mp), has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes. I cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights. The doctor says, this damaged eye is shrinking continuously.\nMy other eye functioning well. I learned to live together with it, however, the doctor says, he strongly recommends enucleation. I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation.\nI have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio, I would happy travel\/pay for that.\nKindly let me know if there is any other option. My main priority -if available- would be to live with my own or another organic eye which doesn't look scary even if it is not functional.\nSecond priority is to have usable organic eye- but my doctor told, this is not yet possible. Please confirm.\nI know you are specialized in\nThank you in advance\n--\nBest regards,\n[CONTACT]\n[NAME]","285":"SUBJECT: hiatal hernia\/exercise\nMESSAGE: i lost 24 lbs. do you have an exercise i can do to correct me hernia?","286":"SUBJECT: physical activity\nMESSAGE: I am a woman aged 59 and had triple heart bypass in 2010.

Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance.

She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off.\nAfter a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk.\nAs she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live.\nPlease help my daughter in this situation.

Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a \"new drug\" requiring appropriate testing.  The \"Vamousse\" head lice treatment claims \"Kills 100% lice and eggs\" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim \"kills 100%\" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming \"100%\".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).
