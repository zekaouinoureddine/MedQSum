{"CHQ":{"0":"soft tissue swelling that moves to different parts of my body.? swelling usually shows up under instep or on individual finger or toe.This is not joint pain.Heel can also swell.I itch in the area that is going to swell,with swelling occurring within hours.the area will return to normal in a day or less.Itchy scalp is present during these outbreaks.It seems to be affected by pressure.if I use a tool that requires squeezing pressure it is likely to cause swelling in that area.\n I may have picked up a bug on a trip to Europe about 5 years ago.The out breaks started after I returned from that trip,and I was quite sick the last day in England.Chills ,profuse sweating that went away the next few days.These outbreaks happen maybe twice a year but I don't know what brings them on.\n Separate work related flare ups can happen randomly.Installing flooring caused the side of my hip and leg to swell ,chills came on later after the day was done.\n Hope somebody recognizes this.My Dr. says \"keep an eye on it\".Thanks joema","1":"Can Borderline personality disorder be passed down to your child? My daughter has BPD. she is 29 now. she has 2 children and I am raising her son who is 10 now. He has emotional problems and is mildly retarded.He has the same symptoms has my daughter started showing at his age.I have realized in the last week that my ex husband has to be BPD too. I took my daughter to see therapists from the age of 8 to 12 then she spend the next 4 years(12 to 16) of her life in hospitals. they wouldn't diagnose her until she was 18. The therapy and hosptals didnt help her. she lives a sad life on drugs and drinking. she is a prostitue at times if she doesn't have the money for drugs.she's been in and out of jail.She doesn't believe anything is wrong with her.

I was on the depo shot after my first baby in 2001. I later stopped getting them after about 3 years. I actually got pregnant again in late 2004. I was getting the shot again after my second baby was born. Now I have stopped since my husband got a vasectomy. I noticed while on the shot I gained weight. Also my periods were all wacky. I could go 2 months or the whole 3 months without a period. I also had very bad mood swings. I also had absolutly no energy and was tired all the time. I am only 24 years old. After getting off the shot the first time I started to lose some of the weight and my periods returned to normal. Someone in another post mentioned that depo depleets the calcium in your body. I fractured my ankle when I stepped down wrong when I was 8 months pregnant with my 2nd child. Normally the way I twisted my ankle would have caused maybe a sprain. But I cracked the bone. Now I am wondering if the depo provera caused my bones to be more brittle.","3":"What treatments are there for OCD?

I couldnt run for about 6 months cause it still hurt. Then after a while I could run again but instead of pain, my right lower leg would go numb sometimes to the point where I feel like I am dragging my foot cause its numb and I have to stop running.  I was diagnosed with compartment syndom in my lower leg and I had a fasciotomy in January.  But when I started running again, my leg still goes numb but now its goes up to the back of my thigh.  Its not pain, its just a numb feeling which is annoying and makes me have to stop running even if its only after 1 mile.  I think they mighthave made the incision in the wrong place (front side of my calf), since now it is becoming more obvious that the numbness is in the back of my leg.

My doctor has asked me to go in for a laparoscopy to find out what kind of cyst it is. My CA-125 test is normal. I asked my doctor if there is any mediaction I could try, but she said there is no such magic pill that will make the cyst vanish.When I type 'ovarian cyst' in some search engines I get to read the Q & A's in some forums. In that I found that many women have said their doctors gave them birth control pills and the cyst got drained. But my doctor says these pills can only in helping prevention of cyst formation in the future. So we have to do laparoscopy now to find out if it is benign and also because if a cyst this big has not gone away in 3 months then it has to be removed or else it may damage the ovaries.

I was a pack-and-1\/2 a day smoker for a decade.  I quit in Aug. '05.  I'm 31yo, I've been doing cardio exercise for months now.  I noticed circulation probs that have become less severe since I quit smoking, but my arms still go to sleep easily while in bed. I also feel short of breath sometimes, when laying down & on the treadmill. The worst symptom is an intense \"pain\" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings after I urinate, it keeps me from going back to sleep. I think \"angina\" describes this pain, but it's in the throat--not the chest. I used to think this was a withdrawl symptom from nicotine. I used to get it back when I was a smoker; it would go away with my 1st morning cigarette. But as I weened myself off nicotine, first with nicorette gum, then cold turkey since Dec '05, the pains have gotten worse and sometimes persist into early afternoon, not every day but at least several days\/week.  I also rarely get satisfying sleep.","20":"Can this be the cause of my sit pain that occurs around my sit bones? MRI: L5-S1: Disk degeneration with mild disk bulging.

My father is suffering from thyroid and anxiety disorder. To make things worse, he is partially blinded.

He has this gambling habit as he want to pay the family's debts (but we could not afford the money for him to gamble so sometimes he would borrow from others to gamble). He is also very isolated because he is adopted and his foster parents always emotionally abused him so he had been struggling to survive since young. This caused him to accumulate all the hatred and thus, small issues that we talk to him now will make him extremely agitated and angry. Now that we are poor, a lot of relatives avoided my family and especially my father. We tried a few counselors but all are unsuccessful in treating him.

Okay, I am a runner-or I was: I developed horrible shin splints last fall, so I stopped running and let them heal.  This is the fourth time shin splints interrupted my seasons, so I decided to see a doctor.  Now, I have been to three doctors, two physical therapists and still I can't run.  There is pain running along both the posterior and anterior AND fronts (though slightlt off the center) of my shins-but I don't have shin splints any more, I don't have compartment syndrome, I don't have bone fractures, and I have been trying orthdodics.

I REALLY want to run again, but it hurts to walk-any suggestions???","45":"How do you lose weight after a medical problem that caused the weight gain? I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism a few years back. I was treated with radioactive iodine and it got rid of my thyroid gland. The doctor I was seeing at the time never gave me a medication to replace the thryoxin the thyroid naturally produces..and is vital to the body's functions.. which caused me to DOUBLE my size in a very short time.  It has been about 3 or 4 years now of trying to get the synthroid dosage [yes, I changed doctors] adjusted so that my system is at a normal level.  NOW, I have about 150 pounds I need to lose.. a vigorous exercise program is impossible because I have also been diagnosed with asthma.  Diet pills are not an option with my medication.. and I refuse to have gastric bypass surgery because I don't eat very much anyway, and the function of gastric bypass is to cause you to eat less.  So what do I DO??? Help!! I don't wish to live my life this way.. I have a young child and I want to play outside with her.. and I want to be able to go for long walks again.","46":"Can you experience symptoms from the morning after pill a week later? I took the morning after pill last Monday (11\/6) which was 2 days after the last day of my period (which started Monday Oct, 30).  A week later (today and last night) I'm experiencing spotting, bloating, nausea, and a little cramping.  According to this female calender on this website, this week would have been the week of me ovulating for sure.  Could this bleeding just be from the pill preventing an egg from coming out or something?  I had sex a few times this past week and I'm paranoid that I could be pregant since it wasn't protected but I'm on the Pill (I take it between the time frames of 10pm-2am). The reason I took the morning after pill was cuz i was a day late in startin a new pack.  So could this pill just be catching up with me?","47":"I have heat rash, but it doesn't go away?

The last time I was at her 5 Bedroom house (she lives alone) all of the rooms were packed to the ceiling including the bathroom and kitchen!  It use to just be the bedrooms.  I don't see how she can live like this.  She can't cook because she can't get to the fride or stove.  She goes to a gym once a week so she can take a shower, because she can't get to hers.

Hi.  I will be going to my doctor soon, but I'm a worrier.  I've had a dull lower abdominal pain for about a week and a half now.  It feels like I'm getting my period (I had my period last month, no problems) or I have to go to the bathroom, but neither scenario is correct.  I pump 6-8 times a day, but the pain is more constant than just when I pump (I know your uterus contracts when you breastfeed\/pump).   I gave birth 4 1\/2 months ago, with no complications, and an all-clear six week follow-up.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this happen?  (And, yes, I have an appointment with my doctor, but it's not an \"urgent\" situation, so I have to wait a couple days)","51":"WOULD THIS CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS DURING PREGNANCY? PLEASE ANSWER!! :)?

I was so proud that I went from 175 to 131 (I'm 5'6\") over the course of several months using regular exercise and a low calorie diet.  I'm 38 and have been somewhat overweight my whole adult life.  However, I can't seem to stop losing it, and now I'm down to 121.  My doctor had told me to stop losing when I hit 130 or so.  My appetite isn't great, and I have chronic tummyaches and diarrhea (but I've had IBS for years now).  The thing is, I have a habit of eating low fat and low sugar foods.  I'm afraid if I eat rich foods I'll get fat again, but I don't want to look bony like I do now.  Plus, I'm not completely sure I could eat more if I wanted to; I have no appetite in the morning and my belly hurts too badly to eat half the day.  If I lose 7 more lbs I'll be cosidered \"underweight\" according to the bmi charts.  Boy, this is starting to sound whiny.  The question is:   am I becoming anorexic (although I routinely eat at least 1200 calories a day)?

Later that night, I discovered that I got sun poisoning on my feet.  I called my on-call doctor (I was, after all 5 hours away from home) and he recommended I take Benadryl to ease down the swelling and pain, and if the vomiting didn't cease, to go to the ER.  I did this, and now, two days later, the pain is gone, as well as the vomiting I experienced the first night. (The only remainder is the horrible purple color of my feet!!!)

I know it has been dead (maybe by washing my hair or the hair dryer) because the tick is flat and dried up.  However, I know it was attached because I heard it popped when I pulled it off.  The head is still attached to the tick but when my grandmother inspected it, there is a distinctive bite mark on the back of my head and a kind of splotchy rash that trails to the nape of my neck - straight down. The rash is square in shape and does not extend above or to the side of the original bite - just straight down about 4 inches.  Is this normal?  No fever, no bulls eye rash, no aching but I have no idea how long it was attached or how long it had been dead.  And Y E S - I'm still GROSSED OUT and all icked out about it. I know it's not Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain Fever.  Too soon for that.... :) I hope... :)","80":"6 year old with persitant cough? i have a 6 yr old step son with a persitant cough brought on mostly when he been playing or excited. Like today he was making a joke, every one was laughing, he was so excited he made \"a funny\" that everyone laughed at and he was laughing so hard he coughed so hard he vomited. Most of the time though when he coughs it's usually after he's been playing hard. My husband and his ex-wife say he has a cold..always he has a cold!! I have asked them to take him to the doctor that maybe he has allergies or bronchitis or something else that is triggering this cough. I have been with my hubby for a year and i have raised 2 older children i know when a child has a cold, this never seems to me to be a cold. The cough is always deep and hard and lasts for more than 5 minutes. Sometimes after playing hard, nothing, sometimes it's pretty bad.

Hi- I am 36 yrs old- and have been battling anorexia since I was about 5 or 6 years old- and this week I am going to an in patient treatment center to try to address some of these issues before this stupid disease or whatever it is kills me. The thinner I get- the thinner I want to be- need to be, it seems- like the \"target\" just keeps dropping, and I DON'T see that I am so emaciated thin and sick looking as EVERYONE I know tells me I am.. The internet says that's the scariest part, is that \"victims\" of this eating disorder don't see how thin they really are. God, I am so scared and really don't have any other option other than letting this thing \"feed\" off my soul, and starve me to death at the same time- I am not afraid to die- but I don't want to die- yet I don't want to live like this anymore...

My grandmother had it and consequently passed away from it, hers was unfortunately the very advanced kind. My mother was diagnosed at age 35 I believe.. she is 47 now. I have exhibited symptoms, but wonder when is a good time to get tested for it? I am 25. How do they test for it? I've brought it up to my PCP ( Primary Care Provider) but most doctors are hesitant to test for this as I've found, since it is a very tricky disease which is hard to diagnose until it's nearly too late to do any good about it. I've also heard mixed results about whether or not the medical community agrees on if it is hereditary or not. I think my family would be a prime example that it IS possible. If you have this, or have family with it I would love your thoughts and insights and any advice you can shed on the subject. Thank you!","83":"Im about to be 18 and i think i have breast cancer....?

For a year now, I have had extreme foot pain, and feel tingling when I rub the tops.  Prolonged standing\/walking is painful, even after as little as 30 minutes.  My foot X-rays do not show much arthritis or osteoporsis.  I just had a blood test and am borderline low in B 12 and wondered if there was some connection there. I am a female, age 55, and very active until this condition started.  The only other symtom I have noted in the past year is more frequent diarrhea.  I don't fit into any of the normal paramaters of foot pain sources, and so far, my podiatrist has not been able to provide much relief.  Part of the problem is that I am unable to take the best NSAIDS, in 3 days I have severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I do wear custom fitted orthotics, and they help, but I still can barely walk sometimes.  Other times there is no pain at all, and there does not seem to be any pattern, except they are way worse when I am on my feet a lot.","86":"today i went to the dr. and had a glucose and thyroid test done? i am very worried i might be a diabetic... my mom was a gestational diabetic, my dad was a diabetic, and my g-ma is a diabetic who has to take insulin. \n\ni am a 21 year old woman who is healthy other than if i dont have food right when i feel i am hungry, i get all light headed and annoyed real easily, a real bad headache and i will feel real weak, and sometimes see light spots. i told mr dr this today and she reccommended that i take those tests, so i did. the results come back on monday, i am nervous.\n\nwhat were the warning signs that you experienced when you were diognosed with diabetes? and how old were u? what is your life like now? \n\ni am just scared, i dont want to have this disease....","87":"What is the best way to quit smoking?

Last night I fell and landed right on my lower back. Right near my \"butt bone\". It hurt badly at the time but I was able to get up and move around right away so I wasnt worried. However about an hour later I started having some pain. Now I have a lot of back problems anyway so part of it might just be my regular back problems. I had a hard time getting comfortable last night because of the back pain but again that isnt all that unusual so I thought about it but not much. Now today we visited my mom and before I even told her she told me she could tell my back was bothering me even though I didnt think it really was. When I first sat or stood it hurt a lot more then normal. And walking up stairs it gave me a lot of pain which usually I have no problems going up stairs. Every once in awhile through the day I got shooting pains. But I am really not in that much pain. Can I wait it out a couple days and see I think I just bruised myself up.

Six weeks ago I had a tachy brought on by lack of sleep (50 hrs) and taking in tons of caffeine (1600mg in 12 hrs).  I have been to tons of doctors, cardiologists, oncologists and have been through tons of tests.  The only thing they have found so far is a slight mitral valve leak.  This could not be causing my heart rate to jump from 60-65 at rest to 100-110 as soon as I stand up.  My heart races with minimal physical exertion and all they found with all these tests was a slight valve leak?  I bought a $50 heart rate monitor and found the 40 to 50 beat jump on my own.  I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.  They are telling me that I am in perfect health and do not have an arrhythmia.  Could I have messed up my nervous system?

I'm wondering if any women here have it, what your symptoms were, and if you went to get treatment. I'm trying to book an appt. with a specialist in the area soon. My symptoms are pretty much the standard ones. Even when I'm touched w\/just a cotton swab, I hurt. Look for more details later... I'm just in a crunch for time right now.","118":"I am having wrist pain and I am not sure what it is.? I have pain in my wrist. It seems to only hurt when I move my fingers. It doesn't hurt if I put pressure on it or anything. When I stretch my fingers or move them, it hurts in my wrist, on the outer side, and then kind of goes up to my elbow.\n\nI had a similar problem in my left hand a few months ago. It started out mild and got worse over time. I put a brace on, but it got to the point where I could barely move my arm without it hurting, but it went away after a while. But I wasn't able to write with it. If I put the brace on as tight as it would go I wouldn't have too much pain.\n\nI was just wondering what the problem could be. I'm not wanting to go to the doctor. \n\nThanks","119":"What is wrong with me? Muscle Aches, Fatigue, High WBC, Arthritis, Stomach Pain, Joint Pain, Low Blood Sugar??

Our youngest daughter is 2 and a half years old. She has to eat by an enteral pump, she has hearing aids in both ears, and cannot walk or talk yet.

My daughter attend occpational and speech therapy for half a day, 5 days a week. About every 6 months, we'll get a letter saying she doesn't meet requirements of \"care at an institutional level\", we'll spend about 3 months fighting to get the errors in their database corrected, then in 3 months, the whole cycle begins all over.

Sometimes I can feel whats happening just as I'm coming out but I usually have no control over the things that I do or say. When I come out of it, I always try to deny that I had a \"spell\" but my family usually knows because I'll start talking completely off the subject that we were on. I can feel myself trying to keep talking just to try to make them believe I'm alright, but I usually say strange or weird things. I currently take medication and it works pretty good. I just want to know what type of seizures I have and what causes it. I had been having my spells for years, trying to get someone to understand what I was talking about.

For a few weeks, he has been experiencing some nausea and a few spells of dizziness. He's only 25 years old, and we're worried sick about him now.

He doesn't have much physical activity, though, because of the lack of time.\nIn addition to that, we're experiencing some financial problems with paying his tuition fees, and he has been thinking and worrying about that, too. He's 25 and all his friends have already graduated from college and university. He is holding a part-time security job, working in the late evenings at lonely, construction sites.
