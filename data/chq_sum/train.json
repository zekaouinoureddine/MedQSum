In 1\/06 I slipped on ice & landed on my knee. It was a good 10 minutes before I could get out of the awkward position I landed in. My knee bruised badly & swelled. Ice & ibuprofen helped. Two weeks later it was better & I walked the 1\/2-marathon I\u2019d been training for since 8\/05. No real problems since then. No pain walking or going up or down stairs. But kneeling, even on a soft surface like a bed mattress, huts. Harder surface=more pain. It also hurts to touch in certain areas. The top\/front has a sort of crater-like depression where the other knee is smooth & convex. It also feels a bit \u201ccrunchy.\u201d I never bothered seeing a doctor. But the ongoing discomfort from such a simple act as kneeling, the crunchiness, & the crater make me wonder if I should be paying more attention. It\u2019s not an inconvenience now, but what if it turns into a progressive condition? I have no idea what (if anything) could be done for  this or whether it\u2019s even worth a trip to the doctor.

I am unable to do much exercise due to my range of mobility being limited from the complications of my illness, so my questions are as follows...  a)Is this diet safe?  I don't know ANYONE who lives on 1000 calories per day, and am finding this diet extremely difficult to adhere to, as there are tons more things you are NOT allowed to have than you are.  b)Does anyone have any advice about exercise options for someone with physical limitations?

The baby continues to vomit (I don't mean spit up....but vomit, with the smell of adult vomit!!).  He doesn't look like he is gaining any weight and even his cry sounds distant.  He looks like he might be in pain.  I know that the grandmother is taking care of him to the best of her ability.

In my understanding, a psychiatrist can diagnose, use therapy and prescribe medication, whilst a psychologist can't prescribe medication.\nThe literature I've read about BPD indicates that medication is not always beneficial, that various forms of long term therapy in which the BP's relearn coping mechanisms and appropriate emotional responses is more appropriate.\nTherefore, would a psychologist be sufficient? Money is an issue as he has recently lost his job again and I understand a psychiatrist is very expensive.\nI have read other peoples questions and answers related to this.

She was a young, beautiful women by any standard. Within two years of being diagnosed with a rare, incurable cancer, leiomyosarcoma (soft tissue tumor). We never accepted the incurable part and she submitted reluctantly to operations, chemotherapy, radiation, and even a experimental drug. She  suffered more than necessary, partly, I suppose, because I  urged her to get the chemo after the first unsuccessful operation. After that, she accepted every new treatment and many hospitalizations. Sometimes I was relieved that she had to go to the hospital when her blood counts went bad. Still, she was upbeat a good part of the two years and even continued to work right up to a month before she died. There wasn't a dry eye in church when the funeral was held one morning.

For my entire adult life (I'm 34 now), I've had a fast metabolism. \n\nI've had my thyroid function tested 2 - 4 times in the past decade, and it always comes back normal. Usually it leans slightly toward the \"fast\" end of normal, but definitely NOT in the range of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). \n\nI've also had bloodwork to see if I have malabsorption of certain nutrients, which could explain my difficulty in gaining weight and might indicate an intestinal or metabolic disorder. Those tests came back normal also.\n\nSo basically I have a fast metabolism and need to live with it. However, now that I got a new job that's more active, and now that I'm on Wellbutrin for my ADHD & anxiety, I'm actually losing weight -- and I don't want to! :( Being underweight has its own set of health risks; it's not just overweight that's bad!\n\nThere's a million ways to boost the metabolism, but I've never heard of anything to SLOW it. I'd prefer natural remedies if possible. Any tips??","52":"Will a mouth guard keep my gums from receding? All my gums are slightly or somewhat receding; however, I had gum grafting on 3 teeth because the gingiva was totally gone. It is currently in the process of healing. I have excellent dental hygiene; however, when I was young I brushed my teeth too hard w\/a hard tooth brush. I use soft electric brush now. My periodontist thinks I might be clenching at night just simply based on my personality. She wants me to get a mouth guard that you put on only the top teeth at night. There's a chance I could be clenching, but I'm not sure. I know I did wake up with my teeth together real tight but that was only one night this week. I don't have periodontal disease. My gums are in good health other than the receding. The periodontist has verified this. I also don't have gingivitis.  Considering all I have just told you do you recommend the mouth guard or would I be wasting my time and money?","53":"All periodontists and dentists please click open this question and answer it.? I had gum grafting for receding gums, but can still see the root on one of the teeth; is this normal?\nI had more and deeper gum receding on one side than on the other side of my lower jaw. I had a total of 2 molars and one side tooth grafted. On the side that was more receded, I can still see about 1 to 2 millimeters of the actual contour of the tooth's root. It's better than before; however, I was hoping that the whole root would be covered after healing. My periodontist says \"the graft will only grow up to the extent of the blood supply, but that's okay as long as I have some\". Does this sound correct to you or did I get cheated for the $2,000-$3000 money I paid?  I could not hardly get any answers; that's why I'm asking this again.","54":"Any ladies with Marphans syndrome?

But definitely my face and jaw so it sometimes feels as if those two teeth are hurting...does that make sense?\nI have several questions.

So, after my dentist did the root canal, he put some medicine in the other tooth and sealed it up.  He said he wanted to watch that tooth to see if that one would have to have a root canal also.  My question is...how can you tell if it needs to have a root canal or not? It doesn't seem swollen or sensitive or anything like that...like I have been brushing it for awhile now and it doesn't hurt or anything like that.  How long after he put the medicine in can you tell if it should have a root canal or not?  What are the symptoms? \n \nLastly and this is kind of embarrassing but...ever since I have begun dental work ( after 10 years or so of not going to the dentist ), I have noticed that I have begun to drool more than usual.  Now, I used to drool...does that have anything to do with it?

One is supposed to drop but sometimes two or three do and you get fraternal twins or trips. identical twins come fom same egg that splits for some reason. all women are not equal and all hormonal and biological processes are perfect or complete everytime. things go wrong.

I have been treated, usually for major depression, severe, for twelve years. I've been on antidepressents, antipsychotics, moodstabilizers, ritalin, etc. I've been hospitalized four times. There is discrepency over what my exact diagnosis is because my symptoms do not match any specific disorder. I have depression that is neither mild (like dystymia) nor fluctuating in recurrances and relapses (like major depression.) It is constant. I also have obsessive compulsive personality disorder, add, anxiety that doesn't fit any of the usual classifications (every few years, for example, I will become terrified that someone is in my house. It is a crippling, agonizing fear, yet I realize that there is no reason I should think this.) I.Q. tests indicate I should do very well in school, but I cannot pass any class except those in English, particularly writing classes. In addition, I have very bizarre patterns of thought, but they are not incredible enough to be called a \"thought disorder.\"","79":"Ihave surface numbness on back of lft upper thigh, lft side foot and heal.

I currently have no major back pain but I can not stand on my left toes from a flat footed position.  My right foot I can.  Muscles in the calve and thigh feel like i just rubbed out a charlies horse.

I am bipolar type-1 and take 40mg paxil daily, lithium and trazadone to deal with my condition.  I feel this regimen is satisfactory in controlling my mood but I still suffer from severe hypochondria anxiety.  It is highly specific, centered around the false belief that I will get HIV even though I am not sexually active for religious reasons.  In fact I'm about as low risk as they come.  But whenever I cut myself or someone's saliva hits me in the eye I panic.  I constantly dwell on \"what if's\" and it has become so severe that it is literally ruining an otherwise happy life.  I have worked with a psychologist to no avail and am now at the point where I need to pursue a drug treatment through to control this anxiety or I no longer be able to function.  Has anyone had luck overcoming this level of hypochondria with the help of therapy and medication?  I am also worried about dependency and anti-anxiety drugs.  Thanks for your input.","81":"Need To know if anyone is like me? **Scared**?

My 4yr old daughter has been getting unexplained high fevers (104-105) for more than 1, 1\/2 year now. A year ago we took her to the ER while she had a high fever and they kept her in the hospital for 12 days and ran many tests, multiple blood test, lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy just to name a few. They could not find any cause for the fever. She also suffers from extreme joint pain and rashes when she gets the fever. They put her on prednisone (steroid) a yr ago at a high dose and the symptoms got better right away. We were told that she has FUO (Fever of unknown origin)which might be caused by a hyperactive immune system. The prednisone was supposed to control her immune system and bring it down to behaving normally. Since about 3 months ago they started reducing her dose and all of sudden all the symptoms are back. They increased the dose slightly and seems to help the symptoms.  The issue is that she cannot stay this medication for long as it has many permanent side effects.","83":"How can I get rid of back acne? My back is full of red bumps and black scars thst itch.

I've been to 3 doctors, the last one supposedly a specialist. However since the foot was not hurting by the time the appointment rolled around - each doctor dismissed it.\nFoot Pain - running from big toe-knuckle to ankle, off and on, sometimes swelling for a few hours. Hurts worse laying down especially at night.\n\nTESTS for Gout and Diabetes or Arthritis in foot are negative. The doctors insist nothing is wrong - because the pain is not present nor swelling by the time I get to see them, It occurs without any set pattern or time. No Injury to foot that I am aware of. I would think an MRI would clear up the mystery but no doctor will do it.\n\nAnyone else have this problem? If so WHAT IS IT!?

I have a wonderful 3-year old son who has just started potty training.

We are now (finally!) on Miralax to get him to a \"clean slate\" and he is obviously soiling his pants. After the fact, he will say he pooped in his pants. We keep telling him it's OK, and it's just an accident, and we're going to get his poopie problem fixed soon. He is so excited about the potty training and wants to do so well and please us, but it is what it is right now. Anyone going through this and have any advice?

He did a filling and told me he drilled pretty deep & close to the nerve. After the novocaine wore off I statred having severe pain in the tooth next to one he worked on. he didn't touch the one the pain is in and I know there is no cavity there because he did whole mouth x-ray. Anyway tooth is so sensitive, I can't even touch it or bite down. It hurts when I tap it, sort of feels like a bruise inside the tooth. Also had sore on inside of my lip and it was swollen like he cut it or hit it with the drill. It's been 4 days without any relief except when I take Advil and that barely touches the pain. Now pain is radiating and gums on that side of mouth are tender and just a little swollen. Anyone know why that tooth that wasn't worked on hurts so bad? Thanks!","88":"Tongue diagnosis help? My tongue has a quite thick white coating at the moment which I know to be because I am currently sick with a virus. However, on the mid-right (my right) side of the edge of my tongue, there is a circular patch that is quite a pronounced red, with no coating at all. It is about 1 centimetre in diameter. Is this telling me that there is a problem with the organ that area of my tongue represents? I am generally not in good wellbeing and tend to get this circular patch everytime I get sick. My acupuncturist use to tell me which organs were represented by each area but I've forgotten. What interests me most is why this patch doesnt have the white coating?","89":"Can someone give me some good  advice about my eating disorder??

I've been doing really well for the past month, but I've started to gain back so much weight. And I keep thinking about if I just lose 15 pounds I'll be happy. The only way I know how to lose weight is by anorexia or bulemia. Diets don't work for me. I just become obsessed with the diet and go overboard or I fall off. \nDo you think 5'5\" and 130 is fat.

She has just 'lured' me in with trust to open up again and she just had an angry outburst filled with twisted reality-all meant to blame me and deflect the root problems.  She usually has outburst of anger lasting four to five days with which she barely will apologize and compromise on the reality of what and why it happened.  She exhibits little remorse and is very protective of her emotions.  Family history is filled with bdp and abuse. She also has an eating disorder, has slept with an adolescent client, engaged in lesbian relations for a few years, now exclusive to men, and has been in most relationships with addicts of some sort. She admits that she manipulates her therapists and has stopped seeing her most recent one.  She actually is a certified Marriage and Family Therapist currently practicing.","92":"Anyone familiar with a medical condition called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity?  And...treatments that work? It's easiest to compare this condition to allergies, although it isn't truly allergy, because it doesn't cause a histimine response.  The symptoms are more closely related to poisoning.  Nausea, disorientation, muscle weakness, achy joints, etc.  These symptoms come from exposure to things we cannot avoid in our society.  Perfumes are lethal to us.  This includes perfumed deodorant, drier sheets, detergent, hair spray, etc.  One of the worst is plug-in air fresheners.  Other things affect us, but the perfumes seem to be hardest to avoid.  Even masks don't help, unless you wear the kind for toxic waste, with big filters attached.  Who wants to wear that to work and the grocery store, etc.  It also seems that more things are perfumed now than a few years ago.  It's hard to find toilet bowl cleaner, shampoo, dish soap, etc. without added perfumes.","93":"Are any of you guys doctors of any sort, I need help ASAP, please?

The use of psychiatric drugs to treat some forms of mental illness is becoming more prevalent.

Others are against this method of treatment because they think that these people should \u201cjust get themselves together.\u201d Hypothesize, based on what you have learned, how these drugs might affect the functioning of the brain.

Lately I've been dizzy, had nausea, my nipples have been killing me. I know that these could be symptoms of PMS too but so far no period. I DO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT with my ob\/gyn so please don't yell at me for not going to the doctor. I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or knows (aside from pregnancy) what I should as my dr. about. PS.

My doctor found a very small trace of blood in my urine and suggested that I might want to see a urologist.  I can not even see it and feel pretty good.  I looked up the tests that urologist do and it seems very unpleasant and I am a big baby.  Do you really think it is necessary to subject myself to this? from what I heard most doctors dont even check urine during routine exams because once they came across this they feel compelled to send the patient to a urologist and most of the time it is nothing.  I am REALLY AFRAID and dont want to see a urologist.  However, I have two children and would really kick myself if 3 yrs from now I found out I had something that could not longer be taken care of. PLEASE HELP ME.","119":"i don't understand the value of treatment? Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD due to severe childhood sexual and physical abuse, and borderline personality disorder.  I hadn't tried to get any help before then, and was involuntarily committed because my roommate caught me drawing pictures with my blood (note to self: keep doors locked).  The doctors gave me a bunch of drugs that made me fat (I gained fifty pounds), so i quit them, and went crazy again (I threw blood on someone, but they deserved it).  So I spent another couple of months in the hospital and stayed fat.  Now I'm out, again, and have been off medication for nine months and am losing weight.  Aside from that I hate myself and sometimes I burn myself and sometimes I have panic attacks if I'm in sexual situations I'm doing pretty well.  All the doctors (at least the ones I can afford) want to do is pump me with medications that make sleepy and stupid and lazy.  Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?","120":"Ghost Pregnancy? I had my first child 7 months ago.  about 2 months ago i started to feel as if i were pregnant again.  the problem is that one of the things that made me 'feel' pregnant was the feeling of something moving inside me, like when a child begins to bump around.  I didn't have sex with my husband for a month after i had my son so if i had gotten pregnant even then i would have been only 4 mo. at the time this bumping around began.  i've also taken 2 pregnancy tests both negative.  so basically, i'm feeling sickly like i were pregnant, i swear i feel a movement of being pushed abruptly from the inside but it's not possible for me to be pregnant.  so i'm wondering if this is common?  perhaps a post partum oddity?  i've heard of people losing limbs and having ghost pains or itches, would that mean it possible to have ghost pregnancy symptoms for a prolonged period of time?  i also appear to have lumps of hard tissue in my stomache, they were there during the pregnancy too.  any theories?","121":"i go tanning alot, do you think this can damage the kidney's?i've been buckled over in pain? i think it's my kidneys that ache because its the same way i felt once when i woke up on a cold water bed.any opinions are appreciated","122":"what are all the symptoms??

What things do they do at the evaluation? And what symptoms did your child have? My sons daydreams alot, he forgets when I just give him 1 task, he cant think on his homework, he gets angry and fustrated very easily. I thought all these things were pretty much common being a kid.

Four weeks ago I had a tachycardia brought on by being awake for about 48hrs and drinking soda\/energy drinks all day and taking a couple vivarin.  My heart was beating quickly and I thought I was having a heart attack.  I went to the ER and they diagnosed me with a tachycardia and told me to get some rest and that I would be fine.  Well, I got my rest and I did not get better.  It has been 4 weeks now and I have completely cut caffeine and alcohol and most sugar and everything else I can think of out of my diet.  I have had several tests done and the only thing my doctor came up with is a leaky mitral valve which he considers to be slight.  He is not concerned about my irregular heartbeat and isn't concerned that my heart now races by performing everyday activities.  I am only 26 years old and have cholesterol of 120! My good cholesterol is 48! My normal resting heart rate was 58, now it is in the high 70's! I have an appointment with a cardiologist next week.

I will be going to a professional next week but I want to know what I can do without going through a long expensive diagnosis that will just tell me what I alread know from having read a lot on the subject and gone to  conferences on ADD\/ADHD. The book \"The Edison Gene\" by Thom Hartman opened my eyes and also \"You mean I'm not lazy, stupid or crazy?!\" is great. I'm a successful consultant but at my age I want to get rid of what's been holding me back quickly now because nothing has worked to give me enough focus  in my thinking patterns. God bless you if you come up with a herb milkshake or medication that helps me to deal with the negatives and utilize the positives of this ADD syndrome that has been holding me back since I was a kid.

When I was a student in an Educational college, students were required to all take a certain class in EdPsych.  A graduate student working for her EdPsych Masters was in charge of teaching  the class of about 120 students.  During the course of study she conducted an experiment with the students in order to show them that schizophrenia could be induced.  The stated objective of the experiment was to get certain students, mostly Catholics, to see that unless they hopped on board the System, doing what was required of them to knowingly get on, they would be prone to this  particular \"disease\".  The experiment, unfortunately, would involve \"sacrificing\" one student.  The experiment itself was to be a hazing.  It was to involve an implosion of tactics including harassment and activity that was to place in a \"locked room\".

He only found this out because he had to be in a psychiatric hospital for a week for a recent destructive outburst..has always been hyper\/manic acting, either extremely mad or extremely happy and loud! He is diabetic, so they could not put him on an antipsychotic because that messes with blood sugar. His diabetes, the doctors say, plays a role in his mood swings also...a low will trigger another seizure in the brain. Before he left the hospital he was put on 250mg of Depakote a day, but since they found out about the EEG, they said that will likely increase significantly. Good thing, because he acts no different at all. They said possibility of IED and symptoms of bipolar...but he never gets depressed.??Anyhoo!!!

I lived my entire life along a river in Michigan that the EPA deamed a \"Superfund Site.\" It has since been cleaned up. At the time I was trying to conceive a child I was unaware that the area I was living in was so contaminated. My 1st child was born with a cleft lip and a congential heart defect - coarctation of the aorta. Could these defects have been caused because of the area I lived, and how can I find out for sure? My other concern is during the pregnancy of my second child the river was being dredged of contaminants and I wanted to know if that put my second child at more risk than my first child. My second child was born at 29 weeks but was only the size of a 26 week old, did that have something to do with living in a superfund site or because I was living in the area during the clean up. There seemed to be an increased number of children born with birth defects while the dredgeing was going on, spinabifida, children born without limbs, coincedence?","166":"My husband has type 1 diabetes and can not control it very well?

Since it had not cured fully, the infection relapses. Same condition would \nhappen incase of other antibiotics i.e. would heal some portion when \nantibiotics applied, but infection relapses again after the course.\n 3. Different doctors both of V.D. and Urology made treatments with various antibiotics of 1st, 2nd and few of 3 rd generations such as ampiciline,doxycycline,ciprofloxacin,sparfloxacin,levofloxacin,nutroforientoin,ceftriaxone,azithromycin etc. available in our country. Ultimate effect of these fillings for along period has created in me acute mental depression (causing vertigo & headache) and I am under psychiatric treatment for seven years with setraline.\n\n4. Lastly, I met Dr. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, professor of urology, CMCH, \nVellore, India where several tests were done as per his advice. One of the \ntests EPS analysis yielded staphylococcus coaglague negative. Urothoscopy \nwas also done, but according to the Doctor no infection was found.\n5. He had prescribed medicine i, e, Cephalexin 250 mg (one at night) along \nwith Z-vit (twice daily) and amittriptaline for 6 months. \n6. I started taking medicines on 15.10.04 and continued for 7 months. \nDuring the course of taking medicines-microscopic exams. of Urine \nhas yielded-\npus cell 3-5 \/ HPF & epithelial cell 3-5\/ HP after 9 days of discontinuation of medicines.\n \n7.Although microscopic exams. of urine signifies that infection may not so grave, but the present condition of the disease is that -the burning, pain, irritation, infection-infection feeling and some times biting & itching sensation within the bolt area (i, e, front part) of penis and also uncanny sensation when urine flows are continuing. These sensations, being at the sensitive end of the penis, are resulting in me headache, depression and vertigo. \n\n8.lastly in Dec.o5, I went to Singapore to a urology expert who examined my blood opined that there is no infection.Accorting to his view it is dew to prostate which brings to me such feeling.

When would a complete removal of the rectum and most of the colon be the answer? My aunt has had severe crohns for about 5 years now. She has done all she could to avoid having surgery.

It has gotten so bad now that the doctors say, it would be best to remove her rectum and mostly all of her large intestine. She has been on imuran and remicade. They said they can not remove the scar tissue from her anal area, because it would leave her incontinent. Does diseased tissue have any chance at all to heal?

He cries for no reason, and I know there is nothing up with him as he stops when he gets picked up, which i think is the reason he does it.  He has now started waking up at all hours many times through the night.  He always dirties his nappy in the night, so know this is a genuine reason, but it is driving me mad.  Also getting verbal abuse from next door neighbour whose bedroom is next to his.  She says she will report me to environmental services if it carries on.\n\nAs soon as he cries in the night, I wake up straight away and go into him.  Sometimes, he is wide awake at 4am so I end up putting him in bed with me and he goes back to sleep.  I know this is a bad thing to do as i now feel he is doing it on purpose to get into my bed.  I am on the verge of depression with this as he is enough to cope with, but now my neighbour is involved I am after some advice.","205":"How long does swollen lymph node usually last?

I was recently playing softball on my school's foeld (which was just sprayed with weed killer and had new dirt spread on it), and when I got home I noticed a strange leopard-like, red rash-thing going up my arm.  I took a shower and some Benadryl, and felt better.  This morning it was no longer noticeable and wasn't itchy, so I went to school.  However, after a fire drill (in which we went outside on a hill near the school, nowhere near the softball field) I noticed the rash again, now also on my hands.  I called my mom to come pick me up, and I am now sitting in her office at work, feeling fine after more Benadryl.  I am, however, still wondering what is happening to me.  Am I allergic to the weed killer, or a bug bite I got or something?  Or is it more serious?  If you have ever experienced or heard of this, please answer.  Thanks!","241":"Help... Problems with flatulence and gas? Serious answers only, please.? I have a really bad flatulence problem. After meals, I often develop gas in my stomach. This is painful and it really hurts my tummy. As the gas goes lower, it also often hurts my lower back. The gas is either very difficult to pass, causing me stomach pain, or I have no control over it and it passes with a loud noise or a foul odor. Either way, it's bad for me, because I either have terrible stomach pains in the middle of the night because of what I ate at dinner (seriously! Sometimes I have to get up around midnight and walk up and down the house in an attempt to release the gas and relieve my stomach), or I get embarrassed in front of people.

Frightened of knives, razors, sharp things...? My friend 'Jesse' has developed a phobia of razors. She was shaving and she cut herself by accident.(It was on her thumb.)She said she \"felt hot and started hallucinating.

I looked at the cut and even though I realized it was just a cut and it wasn't that painful, my mind freaked out on me and I had to lay down for about five minutes, seriously. It sapped my strenght totally.\" This had never happened before, and because there were no drugs or chemicals involved. She felt heat sensations after laying down in a cool room for 5 minutes. We agreed that it was almost certainly a psychological problem. She is scared of knifes, razors, and shard edges now, and is frightened of cutting herself accidentally, as no matter how calm she tries to be when cut, her unconscious mind panics and she starts hallucinating.

His mom has already found out the bovine skull is not necessary for the surgury.\n\nHe is going in for a second opinion in LA and have a MRI of the spine as well. I was just wondering if anyone else had experience with this and knew of other ways to treat it? Some of the info is vague, I'm not sure if it is type 1 or 2, and the cyst is about 4 cm large right now :\/ Thanks so much in advance, and any help is greatly appreciated!","284":"know anything about A\/C joint reconstruction - specifically modified weaver dunn reconstruction..? please!!!? the modified weaver dunn procedure, as described by rockwood (c.

(or is it...? if there is any alternative, i'd be interested to know!)  i understand there have been many variations, including transfer of the coraco-acromial ligament, and reinforcement with permanant sutures. i also understand it is usual to excise the clavicle to prevent bony abuttment with the acromion, yet recent research shows that this resection of the clavicle can lead to a lateral plane instability in the shoulder.  please anyone who knows anything about this - tell me what you know! i have read a few things (from galileo's  original thoughts to more recent medical papers... tho in no way do i claim a comprehensive knowledge :) but i'm a physicist not a orthopaedic specialist! please any info on the injury\/op\/rehabilitation to sports (esp snowboarding :) \nbig thanks\nD ;)","285":"multiple joint pain? what is reason for multiple joint pains?","286":"what are side effects of methatrexate?

A friend of mine called me today to ask if she should turn off her WiFi network, because she heard that they were dangerous for kids and that some schools were removing their networks.\n\nThis was the first I\u2019d heard of this, but I guess it makes sense that if mobile phone masts are considered dangerous and aren\u2019t allowed to be placed near schools, then I guess WiFi networks could also be transmitting harmful radiation. Running a WiFi network at home could be the same as having a mobile phone mast in your front room.\n\nI did some digging around and I did find some details. Mobile phone masts and the low-level radiation they create have been linked with losses of concentration, headaches, fatigue and possibly cancer.","289":"Serious life changing heat intolerance, help needed pleaseeeeeee?

I had pains in my lower left abdominal area for a few days.  Went and saw my family doctor and he believed that it was an ovarian cyst.  He did a pelvic exam and then ordered an ultrasound for me.  He informed me that it was nothing to worry about but if the pain increased, to come back.  I believe that the pelvic exam caused my cyst to rupture as that night I was in excrutiating pain but as it was after 11pm and I was home alone with my 2 children, I dealt with it.  I called my doctor in the morning to ask if he needed to see me & I told him I believed the cyst had ruptured.  He informed me that there's nothing they can do for me and should not bother coming down to his office.

Now it seems as if it has grown and now i have a few more bumps which are very painful but dont look like the ones ive started with.

A friend of mine who is in her 60's recently bought a laptop and is desperate to be able to use it - however, she has found that using it for any length of time is making her feel ill. For some time, she has found that reading a book or using a mobile gives her a \"heavy feeling\" across the top of her head, over her brow, and pain behind the eyes. She also starts to feel lethargic, sleepy and sometimes a little nauseous. This can last for days at a time , and has started occurring anytime she uses the laptop.\n\nShe does wear glasses but an optician checked her vision and her lenses and all appears fine. Her GP referred her for an MRI scan, but it showed nothing abnormal.\n\nPainkillers don't help, and she has tried all manner of alternative therapies, from crystal healing to reflexology, but nothing seems to help.

I have had braces once already, but my top two teeth still have a gap, caused by a strong frenum. They are basically growing sideways, into each other. This causes a \"v\" shaped gap in my two front teeth--it looks like I have pepper stuck between them! An orthodontist told me that he can only correct this by putting braces on again, and after they are off proceeding with a fernectomy. He says that doing the fernectomy first will cause scar tissue, which will hinder my teeth from straightening, and that a retainer will not correct this problem, either.

How soon would you want to know? Antioxidants are substances that may protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals. Free radical\n damage may lead to cancer. Antioxidants interact with and stabilize free radicals and may prevent some of the damage free radicals otherwise might cause. Examples of antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamins C, E, and A to name a few.\nWhen you have too few antioxidants to counteract your free radicals, significant damage can occur, leading to a variety of chronic degenerative diseases, ranging from stroke and fibromyalgia, to sinusitis, arthritis, vision problems, and even Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. A poor diet, cigarette smoking, environmental pollutants, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun also increase the free-radical load, creating a situation known as \"oxidative stress.\"","354":"Can i return to my job as airline pilot after this medical problem below ?(first class faa medical)?

I asked him if a blood test would show if I had diabetes. He said it does and then said my blood tests are fine. Then I got a letter from him telling me my glucose has improved. I was never told that my glucose was not normal. What does this letter mean? He has not asked me to make another appointment nor has he scheduled other tests for me.

Almost a year ago I had an episode of Anxiety, Shortness of breath and dizziness. Went to the ER and after examination and several EKGs been diagnosed with pretty much nothing (neuro-vegetative disturbances) and prescribed to take calcium and magnesium supplements. Checked with my doc and he ran blood tests which came back normal, except for a mild Anemia (low Iron, magnesium and ionic calcium levels, not too low but near-minimum). Doc prescribed iron supplements. Gradually the sensation of not getting enough air pretty much dissapeared. During the summer I experienced a mild sinus Tachycardia (rate about 90-100) treated with Propranolol. Now my pulse is around 70 and I do not take any more pills for it - it sometimes rises especially after exercise, and doc told me I am not in the best physical condition (raises to about 90-95 for a few minutes after stopping). However, I still get a permanent feeling of Shortness of breath, not like my lung doesn't fill normally with air, more like needing a good deep yawning or like my breathing muscles are too tense and can't let me take a really deep satisfying breath - all is well until trying to inhale the last \"bit\" of air, when I get this sensation. Also my chest hurts, sometimes in the left area, sometimes in the right, almost always near the sternum. The chest hurts when pressed with my finger. Ribs are painful too. When I contract my chest muscles the pain increases slightly. The pain is not intense and goes away for a few days, comes back for a few days in some other area in my chest. Sometimes my ankles hurt a bit and my right hand, the small bones right near my fist. Fingers at my right hand are painful at times. These pains go away quickly when applying Ibuprofen or the like(spelled it right I hope) to the area. However they are back after some hours. I have done blood tests 3 times in the last year, went to 3 different cardiologists, had Echo of the heart, Echo of the abdomen, neurological exam, Spirometry, stress Echo,etc. etc, everything is OK. I went to the cardiologist when I was at peak with my symptoms and nothing was found I am currently taking mineral supplements and following psychological counselling since I have developed a strong fear that something is deeply wrong with me. When in session and days after I feel ok, no more symptoms. My symptoms are generally not very intense, I feel like my fear is amplifying them somehow. I am a 25 year old male, no heart disease or other medical condition, good health, good family health, not overweight, smoker (under 1 pack a day), not in best fitness (sitting job - programmer). My questions are: 1. If sometimes were wrong with my heart, would it have been diagnosed yet? 2. Need I do more investigations regarding my heart? 3. Does all this look more like a psychological condition than a physical one? 4. In a few words: how should I change my lifestyle in order to keep my heart healthy? Thank you for reading this message.

I have done some research and have come up with either vulvodynia or lichen sclerosis?  I am almost always irritated as well, sometimes yeast sometimes not.  Needless to say, marital relations could be much better.  I have been dealing with this for about 7 years and have been to at least 5 doctors multiple times with no conclusion.  Which leads me to this question,  if anyone is familiar with any doctors in Michigan, preferably southeast Michigan, I could really use a good referral, or even a website if anyone knows of one, to look for specialists in this area.  The other question I have is about lubrication.  Lubrication helps at least a little bit, I think part of the problem half of the time is friction, I just do not produce a lot of natural lubrication.  None of the brands I have tried have been very good, dry up fast and are sticky.  I have heard olive oil, but haven't tried yet, has anyone out there tried olive oil?  I have tried durex, astroglide, and ky.  Don't like any of them.  I have also read slippery stuff?  Don't know where to find that, any suggestions?

The only trouble we are having is that the titanium plate is gradually becoming more exposed on the outside of his face.

From that point on I have had face pain and noticed a swollen gland in my neck.  I was very tense from the problems with my daughter and I notice even now that I hold my jaw tensley and sometimes clench my teeth.   I believe that the stupid dental thing in my mouth injured the muscles\/tendons in the tmj area and exacerbated any tension I already had in that area.  Now I have alot of the typical teeth clenching\/tmj symptoms such as occassional ear pain, head and neck pain and tightness down that side of my head, neck, and back, AND I still have swollen glands in my neck on that side.

I am currently being evaluated for autonomic dysfunction.  My doctor got me in with a neurologist, but that's not till July.  Currently, my symptoms best fit with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (also called Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome) and I also shown several signs of connective tissue disorder (possibly Ehlers-Danlos).  Anyways, I was a normal guy until my symptoms had sudden onset in January.  I've had chest pain before, but I've never been woken up by it.  It lasted for a couple minutes and then subsided, but comes back when I take a deep breath.  If it was a heart attack or aortic dissection\/rupture then I'm pretty sure I would feel way worse than just chest pain.  It's on the left side, right over my heart and inward toward the edge of my sternum.  Any ideas?  Please no sarcastic answers, I'm already dealing with enough as it is.","520":"childhood sexual trauma and orientation confusion? Between the ages of 6 and 10 I was repeatedly molested and physically abused (burned with cigarettes mostly, at least that's where I got most of my scars) by close relative.  Now that I'm older I'm very confused about my sexual preferences (or more accurately, lack thereof).  I understand that my past has a significant impact on this, but is it a good idea to find out how much of an effect it had?  The only time I've ever had sex with someone I felt anything for was with another guy (who, a few weeks after branding his name into me, told me he didn't want to see again).  With everyone else I've pretty much a passive, unemotional object (girls or boys), and I do understand that aspect stems from my childhood.  But what does it mean if I turn out gay or straight or anything else?  Should it matter that the only reason I'm capable of feeling anything close to love for another male is because I was tied down, raped, and tortured so often I'm incapable of understanding gender roles, etc?","521":"Anyone know the side effects of quitting Klonapin(Clonazapam)??

No human or animal research yet).\n\nBeyond the possible anti-cancer properties of the above, it looks like the ginger can help with nausea from the chemo and inflamation and the maitaki mushroom can help with immune system and chemo side effects.","530":"Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?
